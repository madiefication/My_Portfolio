    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Secret Image Sharing Using Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm</h3>
        <p>This project implements a secure image encryption system using k-n Secret Sharing and AES-256 encryption to safeguard sensitive images. The encrypted image is split into multiple shares, requiring at least k shares for reconstruction. Digital watermarking ensures authenticity, while secure cloud storage provides reliable access. A user-friendly GUI simplifies interaction, and performance optimizations allow efficient processing of large images. This solution offers a practical approach to secure image transmission with enhanced security and usability.</p>
